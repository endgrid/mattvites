If you have ever thrown a party, you know how frustrating it is to get "maybe" responses to invitations.

I worked with a group of party engineers to design an invite that would convert "maybes" into "attendings."

The goal was to craft an invite that would fascinate someone so deeply that it would compel them to attend to sate their curiosity.

The Black Card was born--a minimalist NFC card with a link to our invitation.

We gave these out on the weekends leading up to our event with great success.
